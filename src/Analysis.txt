Gadsby can be compressed more when using its own encoding
because it does not contain the letter e, so standard english character frequencies
cannot approximate Gadsby as accurately; e is one of the
most common characters in the dictionary, and as such it is a wasted character code.
By encoding Gadsby using itself, we can create a more accurate frequency approximation
of the character values, and therefore create a more optimal set of compression
codes to ensure that the shortest encodings are for the most frequent characters.
